### Don't

- No spam! Small contributions like minor styling or spell correction are accepted but obvious spam for the t-shirt will be labeled invalid.
- Don't use prettier/auto indent/ auto format because it will create HUGE merge conflicts
- Do NOT add any build steps e.g. npm install (I want to keep this a simple static site).

## Contribution Rules (Will be updated)

### Do

- Keep pull requests small to minimize merge conflicts.
- Make sure there is no merge conflict
